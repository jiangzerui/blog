 **Today is the second day, I have been quitting smoking for 33 hours!**
   
      
   I had fail to fall asleep until about 3:00 am last night. but I had wake up so early at 6:00 am. I realized that I had the symptoms. It is hard time! while my wife doesn't konw that, my mother do neither, what make me free, not stress. I wish I can quit somking naturally without someone focus on me. 

   Given the test of MBA will coming soon, I also hope the symptoms dismiss asap.
